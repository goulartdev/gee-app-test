A simple app that loads a Landsat image from Google Earth Engine into Open Layers.

## How to run:

`npm install && npm run start`

and then open http://localhost:3000.

You must provide a private key for authentication with Google Earth Engine. It should be a `privatekey.json` file on the app root folder.

This link shows how to generate a private key:
